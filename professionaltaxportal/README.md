# Professional Tax Portal - In-Depth Project Guide

Welcome! This guide explains what the Professional Tax Portal project does, how it's organized, and what each part is for, using simple language but with more technical detail and references to the actual code and files.

## What is this project?
This is a full-stack web application for managing professional tax registration. It allows users to enter, update, and view their tax-related details. The backend is built with Java (Spring Boot), and the frontend is built with React (JavaScript).

## Project Structure
The project is split into two main parts:
- **Backend** (`professionaltaxportal`): Handles all data, business logic, and database operations.
- **Frontend** (`EmploymentDetails-frontend`, `nic_project`): The user interface that people interact with in their web browser.

## Backend: professionaltaxportal

### Main Application
- **ProfessionaltaxportalApplication.java**: The entry point for the backend. It starts the Spring Boot server and loads all configurations.

### Configuration (`config/`)
- **CorsConfig.java**: Sets up CORS so the frontend can communicate with the backend from a different address (like `localhost:3000`).
- **ModelMapperConfig.java**: Provides a ModelMapper bean for converting between entities and DTOs.

### Data Transfer Objects (`dto/`)
- **ApiResponse.java**: Standardizes API responses with fields for success, message, data, and applicationId.
- **EstablishmentDetailsDTO.java**: Used to transfer establishment details, including a list of establishments.
- **EstablishmentTypeDTO.java**: Transfers establishment type and category info.
- **PersonalDetailsDTO.java**: Transfers personal details, with validation for fields like name, gender, mobile, and email.
- **ProfessionDetailsDTO.java**: Transfers professional details, including business info, PAN, and vehicle counts.
- **TradeDetailsDTO.java**: Transfers trade-specific details, similar to professional details.

### Entities (`entity/`)
- **Area.java, District.java, Charge.java**: Represent master data tables for areas, districts, and charges.
- **PTaxCategory.java, PTaxCategorySubcategory.java**: Represent tax categories and subcategories.
- **TempApplicantEnrolmentDetails.java**: Stores temporary applicant registration info (name, gender, contact, etc.).
- **TempApplicantEmploymentDetails.java, TempApplicantProfessionDetails.java, TempApplicantTradeDetails.java, TempApplicantCallingDetails.java**: Store detailed info for each applicant's employment, profession, trade, and calling.

### Repositories (`repository/`)
- **TempApplicantEnrolmentDetailsRepository.java**: Provides methods to find and check applicants by applicationId or mobile.
- **TempApplicantProfessionalDetailsRepository.java**: Provides methods to find and delete professional details by applicationId.

### Resources (`resources/`)
- **application.properties / application.yml**: Configure server port, database connection, JPA settings, CORS, and file upload limits.
- **static/** and **templates/**: Reserved for static files and templates (currently empty).

### Tests (`test/`)
- **ProfessionaltaxportalApplicationTests.java**: Basic test to ensure the Spring context loads.

## Frontend: EmploymentDetails-frontend & nic_project

### Main Files
- **public/index.html**: The HTML template loaded in the browser.
- **src/index.js**: Entry point for the React app; renders the main `App` component.
- **src/App.js**: The root React component; sets up the main structure and routing.
- **src/Component/PTAXEnrollmentForm.jsx**: Handles the main tax enrollment form, collecting user data and sending it to the backend.
- **src/Step3Establishment.js, src/Step4OtherDetails.js**: Handle specific steps in the multi-step registration process.
- **App.css, Establishment.css, index.css**: Style the user interface.

### How the Frontend Works
- Components are organized by steps or features (e.g., establishment details, other details, enrollment form).
- Each form or step collects user input and, on submit, sends the data to the backend using HTTP requests (usually with `fetch` or `axios`).
- The frontend expects JSON responses, which are handled and displayed to the user (success messages, errors, or data).

## Integration: How Frontend and Backend Work Together
1. **User fills out forms** in the React frontend (e.g., PTAXEnrollmentForm.jsx).
2. **Frontend sends data** to the backend API (Spring Boot) using HTTP POST/GET requests (URLs like `/api/...`).
3. **Backend receives the request**, validates and processes the data using DTOs and entities, and saves it in the database.
4. **Backend responds** with a JSON object (often using ApiResponse.java), indicating success or failure and returning any requested data.
5. **Frontend updates the UI** based on the backend response (showing confirmation, errors, or next steps).

---

## Example Flow
- User enters their personal and business details in the React form.
- On submit, the frontend sends a POST request to `/api/enrolment`.
- The backend receives the request, maps the data to a DTO, validates it, and saves it as an entity in the database.
- The backend responds with a success message and application ID.
- The frontend displays the confirmation and may allow the user to proceed to the next step.

## Why is this useful?
- Makes tax registration easier and more organized for users and administrators.
- Keeps all information in one place, safely stored in a database.
- The code is modular and easy to maintain or extend.
- Clear separation between frontend and backend makes updates and debugging easier.
